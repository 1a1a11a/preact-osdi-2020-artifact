========== 0. INTRODUCTION

BeatLex is software for summarizing and forecasting time series data containing patterns. 

BeatLex consists of 3 main functions:

- summarize_seq: for summarizing a sequence 
- forecast_seq: for forecasting
- tune_hyperparams: used to select algorithm hyperparameters (Smin, Smax, maxdist).

========== 1. GETTING STARTED

The easiest way to get started is to simply run "main_ecg_example" and "main_mocap_example". These run forecast_seq and summarize_seq on an example ECG or motion capture time series (on example data included in this package), and generates plots in the plots/ directory of this package. 

These scripts also show examples of how to use tune_hyperparams, but provide pre-chosen parameters for convenience.

========== 2. FUNCTION REFERENCE: INPUT/OUTPUT

---------- (a) summarize_seq
This function summarizes the given time series (i.e. learning a segmentation, vocabulary terms, and an assignment of which vocabulary term should be used to describe each segment).

Input: 
X (a d by m time series), where d is the dimensionality and m is length
Smin (min segment length)
Smax (max segment length)
maxdist (max warping distance, i.e. Sakoe Chiba band width)
verbose (verbosity level: 0 for low and 1 for high)

Output: 
models (a list of vocabulary terms)
starts (starts of each segment)
ends (ends of each segment)
idx (index of vocabulary term assigned to each segment)
best_prefix_length (can usually be ignored; this indicates the partial matching of a vocabulary term at the end of the data)
tot_err (total error in terms of description length)

---------- (b) forecast_seq
This function forecasts data. Note that it does this by first running summarize_seq, so a lot of the output it returns mirrors those of summarize_seq. 

Input: 
X (a d x m time series), where d is the dimensionality and m is length
pred_len (number of time ticks to predict)
Smin (min segment length)
Smax (max segment length)
maxdist (max warping distance, i.e. Sakoe Chiba band width)
verbose (verbosity level: 0 for low and 1 for high)

Output: 
Xp (forecasted time series of size d x pred_len)
idx (index of vocabulary term assigned to each segment)
starts (starts of each segment)
ends (ends of each segment)
p_idx (same as idx, but corresponding to the forecasted region)
p_starts (same as starts, but corresponding to the forecasted region)
p_ends (same as ends, but corresponding to the forecasted region)
models (a list of vocabulary terms)

---------- (c) tune_hyperparams
This function uses grid search to tune Smin, Smax and maxdist based on minimizing the description length criterion. 

Input: 
X (a d x m time series), where d is the dimensionality and m is length

Output: 
best_Smin (tuned value of Smin, i.e. min segment length)
best_Smax (tuned value of Smax, i.e. max segment length)
best_maxdist (tuned value of maxdist, i.e. Sakoe-Chiba band width)
