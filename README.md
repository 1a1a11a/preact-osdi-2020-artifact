# PREACT OSDI 2020 Artifact Evaluation
There are two main artifacts in PREACT:
1. The main results are simulation based. The simulator in in the `simulator` folder.
2. We also have a PREACT-enabled HDFS to show that it is easy to incorporate PREACT in an actual distributed file system. The HDFS code is in the `hdfs` folder.

Each folder has their own README files that describe how to run the two artifacts.
