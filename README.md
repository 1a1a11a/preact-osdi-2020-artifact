# PREACT OSDI 2020 Artifact Evaluation
There are two artifacts for the PREACT submission in OSDI 2020:
1. The main results are simulation based. The simulator execution instructions are in the [README](simulator/README.md) in the `simulator` folder.
2. We also have a PREACT-enabled HDFS to show that it is easy to incorporate PREACT in an actual distributed file system. The HDFS code is in the `hdfs` folder. The dfs-perf evaluation has to be performed once the HDFS cluster has been setup (refer the [HDFS README](hdfs/README.md)).
